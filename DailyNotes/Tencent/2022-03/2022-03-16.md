## Troubleshooting “Invalid Character Looking For Beginning Of Value”

在试图将`http.Response.Body`解析为JSON格式的时候出现了以上错误，原因基本上是返回的是一个HTML的格式。

Here’s an error I often come across with Golang applications:

```
invalid character '<' looking for beginning of value
```

This error is frustrating to those who first encounter it because it comes across as archaic. Where is the **<** character coming from, and why is it causing errors? What underlying library is throwing this, and how can you fix it?

Unfortunately, the resolution depends on a case-by-case basis. However, in this post, I hope to help troubleshoot to lead you down the right path.

## The Root Cause

This error message is thrown by the [encoding/json](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/) Golang package. This error happens when the json package attempts to unmarshal a string that is not JSON. Consider you are trying to unmarshal an HTML string using the JSON library:

```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head>
. . .
```

The first character, **<**, is not a valid JSON starting character, hence the reason for the error “invalid character ‘<‘ looking for beginning of value”.

Receiving an HTML response is not the only possible way to encounter this error. For example, if you were trying to unmarshal this string:

```
Hello world!
```

Then you would end up with the error “invalid character ‘H’ looking for beginning of value”.

## Troubleshooting The Error

You will encounter this error when your application reaches out to an API and expects a JSON response but receives data in a different format instead. To troubleshoot, try to identify what endpoint your application is trying to reach when it encounters the error. Try to **curl** this endpoint manually from your command line. What kind of response do you get?

I ran into this issue earlier in the week and found that the app I was troubleshooting tried to call an API that didn’t exist!

```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>404 - Page Not Found</title>
. . .
```

You may also receive a non-JSON response if you have failed to authenticate. Try to curl from the command line, passing in the **-u** flag for basic authentication (or -H “Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN” for OAuth) and see if you get a 401 (Unauthorized) or 403 (Forbidden). These errors will produce the error if the response is not in JSON format.

Of course, you can also use a debugger to resolve this error. In my case, I could curl from the command line to determine the issue, but a debugger can serve as a more robust alternative if you are still stuck.

原因是没有加上协议头`http`或者`https`


## Go语言零值的定义

开发中经常会遇到空指针异常的问题，原因是除了几个基本类型，其他类型的“zero value”都是`nil`
